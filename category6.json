        "answer2": "After being sick",
        "answer3": "After eating curry",
        "answer4": "Before eating fruit",
        "hint": "It's true - you should never brush your teeth straight after being sick! This is because your stomach contents - and therefore your mouth - are extremely acidic, so brushing can wear away your teeth's enamel. The other two times you shouldn't brush, says London's Dr Manouchehri, are straight after breakfast or after eating sweets. Especially if you eat sweets for breakfast!",
